# OMORIcraft
 OMORI inspired plugin for Spigot 1.16.5.
 
## Features
* **Emotions:** now all entities have emotions which can be affected by different actions and environment.
* **Battle System:** Emotions have strengths and weaknesses against other emotions, choose wisely before jumping into battle.
* **Auras:** When in battle you'll be able to see colored aura of the entities you are fighting with so you'll be able to plan your strategy.
* **Empowered Mobs:** According to the emotion there are mobs that will have different effects. (Eg: Creeper emotion dictates their explosion power)

## Planned Features
* **Redstone:** We want to include some way of making mechanisms that can interact with emotions, this way you can build new environments to control the battle and emotions according to your needs.
* **Classes:** We look forward to introduce classes with different skills that can be used to provide more depth into the gameplay.
* **More mob effects:** One of my plans is that each update includes hopefully 1 new mob covered.
 

## WIP
I will update this readme I swear.
